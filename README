== EmissionsTest.js

A simple script to notify you of possible pollution in the global namespace.

== Installation/Usage

Include the included EmissionsTest.js before any other JavaScript on your page. 
After the page has finished loading and a respectable amount of time has elapsed,
an EmissionsTest report will be delivered to the console (or will be appended 
to the document if `window.console` does not exist).

We don't recommend using EmissionsTest.js in production, but it can be quite 
useful during development.
